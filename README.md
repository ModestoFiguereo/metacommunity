# Meta Community Site

This is the code for the homepage of Meta Community, a community of Dominican Software Development Communities and Usergroups which aims to help each usergroup to reach more people, improve their resource management and channel sponsorship efforts.

Feel free to open issues, participate in those, and offer to tackle any issue that is not currently being worked on.

The live site is located at http://metacommunity.herokuapp.com/ and is deployed once a week.

Bear in mind that this is a community driven effort, and answers to your issues or pull requests may take some time to process.
